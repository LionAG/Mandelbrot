# Mandelbrot
This program generates a visual representation of the Mandelbrot set, a mathematical object, using complex numbers and iterative calculations.

The program maps the x and y coordinates of the console screen to the complex plane, and then iterates over each point to calculate its membership in the Mandelbrot set.
